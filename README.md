Dossier keeps your career history in one profile and turns it into a clean resume. For every job you apply to, it reads the posting, shows how you match, and drafts a tailored resume and cover letter that only use facts from your profile. You refine them in a chat, download them as PDFs and track each application from draft to offer.

It's for one person on a small server: one password, your data in your own PostgreSQL database, and an AI model of your choice. That can be a local model through Ollama or LM Studio, so your profile and documents stay on your own hardware, or a hosted one (any OpenAI-compatible API, Anthropic or Mistral), which then receives what it writes from. [Privacy](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Privacy) says what goes where.

**Get started:** [run it on your computer](#run-it-on-your-computer) in a few minutes, or [self-host it](#self-hosting) on a server. The [installation guide](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki) covers every way: Docker with or without Compose, Node.js, a plain Ubuntu server, CapRover, Coolify and Dokploy.

## This fork

This is a fork of [AienTech/dossier](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier) with changes made for my own job search:

- **JSearch's 10 s timeout was too tight.** A live request against OpenWeb Ninja's JSearch API took 10.3 s to answer, so every search lost the race against Dossier's hard-coded 10-second limit and came back "JSearch isn't answering right now" even with a working key. [`src/lib/job-search/http.ts`](src/lib/job-search/http.ts) now waits 25 s.
- **Blocked companies.** Settings → Job search has a new "Blocked companies" list: Find jobs, the job agent and the Claude connector never show, score or draft an application for a posting that names one of these as the company, or mentions it in the title or description — which also catches a staffing listing for a role placed there. See [`src/lib/job-search/blocklist.ts`](src/lib/job-search/blocklist.ts).
- **Firecrawl, a fourth job source.** JSearch and Adzuna each index one source; Firecrawl instead runs two web searches — one biased toward LinkedIn, Indeed, Naukri, Glassdoor, Monster, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday and SmartRecruiters, one wide open with no site restriction at all for whatever that list misses (a smaller board, a company's own careers page) — merged into one page, the way actually googling "data engineer jobs in Bengaluru" would, without Dossier maintaining a scraper per site (which breaks the moment a site's markup changes, and risks its terms of use). Get a key at [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys) and choose it in Settings → Job search. See [`src/lib/job-search/firecrawl.ts`](src/lib/job-search/firecrawl.ts).
- **Falls back across sources.** Save a key for more than one source (JSearch, Adzuna and Firecrawl each keep their own, independent of which is "chosen") and a fresh search tries the chosen one first, then moves on to the next with a key saved if it's out of quota, down, or doesn't cover that country — instead of just failing. A kept search's "Show more" always stays on the exact source it started with. See [`searchWithFallback` in `src/lib/job-search/find.ts`](src/lib/job-search/find.ts).
- **Hyperlinks on the resume.** Email, website and LinkedIn in the header were plain text; they're links now (`mailto:`, `tel:` and `https://`), styled the same muted, underline-free way as a publication's citation link. See [`src/lib/resume-content.ts`](src/lib/resume-content.ts) and [`Contact`/`ContactLine` in `document-page.tsx`](src/components/documents/document-page.tsx).
- **Firecrawl searches applicant-tracking systems directly.** Measured on 28 October 2026: ORing many `site:` domains into one web query (what this fork did at first) returned mostly pages that *list* jobs ("2,000+ Data Engineer jobs | LinkedIn"), which is where the irrelevant results came from. Firecrawl now runs a handful of `site:` searches two ATS domains at a time — Ashby, Lever, Greenhouse, Workable, SmartRecruiters, Workday, Breezy, Teamtailor, Pinpoint, each checked against real indexed postings — plus LinkedIn's and Naukri's own posting pages and one open careers-page search, and leaves out every page that isn't one posting (counted, not hidden silently). Domains that returned no postings when checked (BambooHR, Keka, Darwinbox, Recruitee) are left out rather than guessed. See [`queries.ts`](src/lib/job-search/queries.ts) and [`ats.ts`](src/lib/job-search/ats.ts).
- **Every source at once, each job once.** A fresh search asks every source with a key (or, if you prefer, falls back one at a time — Settings → Job search), shows a job found by two sources once, rests a source that just failed instead of asking it again on every search, and says which sources were searched, skipped or failed and why. See [`find.ts`](src/lib/job-search/find.ts), [`health.ts`](src/lib/job-search/health.ts), [`dedupe.ts`](src/lib/job-search/dedupe.ts).
- **Relevance you can audit.** Every result gets a score out of 100 against your profile — skills it names, title against your target roles, seniority against your years, whether it's open to someone in India, pay against your floor (₹40 LPA unless changed; only rupees are compared, undisclosed pay is never guessed), freshness (a search engine's page date is labelled as such, never passed off as the posting date) and whether the link is the employer's own — with the reasons and concerns listed. A posting whose own words put it outside India, below your floor or nowhere near your roles is left out, with a button to show it. Filters by role or skill, relevance, location, salary, age, source and direct apply. See [`relevance.ts`](src/lib/job-search/relevance.ts).
- **One-page resumes by cutting, never by shrinking — now the default.** A tailored resume that runs over leaves out its summary first, then the bullet or project least relevant to the posting, one at a time, keeping every company in reverse-chronological order; only then the least relevant whole role (never the most recent), then publications. Type, spacing and margins are never touched and a kept bullet is never shortened; the full skills section is always there. Every step is measured in the real PDF, and everything left out is listed with "Put back". See [`page-limit.ts`](src/lib/page-limit.ts). Two pages is still a choice in Settings → Documents.
- **The master resume's original is kept.** Every resume you import is stored exactly as uploaded (latest 5, downloadable from Profile → Import from a resume), apart from your profile and every tailored resume. The import now flags any bullet it didn't find word for word in the file, and any number the file doesn't contain, for you to check before it's used.
- **Resume variants.** Profile → Resume variants: e.g. "GCP Senior Data Engineer", "Azure Senior Data Engineer", each with a positioning line and the skills to lead with — only skills your profile has. Each application uses the variant its posting fits best (or the one you pick in New application) and says so; a variant changes emphasis only, never facts.
- **The job agent ranks before it spends.** It searches every source, leaves out what relevance rules out before any AI call, scores the most relevant first, can run up to three times a day (Settings → Job agent), and says which source failed.
- **About this job, and no duplicate drafts.** An application's Job posting tab shows where the job was found and when, the apply link, eligibility, salary (stated, estimated or not disclosed) and relevance. Find jobs won't start a second application for a job that has one unless you ask for another version. Nothing is ever sent automatically.

Everything else — the profile, resumes, cover letters, tracking, the job agent, the Claude connector — is upstream Dossier, unchanged. [Build and run this fork](#build-and-run-this-fork) below; [upstream's own instructions](#run-it-on-your-computer) pull their published image instead, without these changes.

## Demo

![Dossier in use: the dashboard, dragging a card on the board, a new application from a pasted posting, refining the tailored resume in the chat, the cover letter, and switching resume themes](.github/images/demo.gif)

<sub>Recorded with the demo data (Jane Doe is made up) and a stand-in AI server that answers at once, played at 1.2× speed. With a real model, reading a posting and writing the documents takes from a few seconds to a few minutes.</sub>

## Features

- **Profile:** basics, skills and languages, experience, projects, education, publications and references, in the order you choose, with a strength meter that counts only what a profile needs. Projects (side, open-source, course or thesis work) show what you can do where your job titles don't yet. Publications are cited in your own style, with bold and italics, and go on resumes word for word. Start it from an existing resume (PDF, Word or Markdown) if you like.
- **Base resume:** twelve themes and a theme builder, previewed live and printed to PDF on the server. Duplicate themes, or share them as files.
- **Find jobs:** search postings near your city, or anywhere you choose, through JSearch (LinkedIn, Indeed and more), Adzuna, or Firecrawl (this fork: one web search across LinkedIn, Indeed, Naukri, Glassdoor, Greenhouse, Lever and company sites at once — see [This fork](#this-fork)). Save the good ones, dismiss the rest, score any of them against your profile, and start an application from a posting with one click. Block a company in Settings → Job search (this fork) and no search shows it again.
- **Startups:** startups that are hiring, from YC startups' job posts and Hacker News' monthly “Who is hiring?” thread, kept to the ones that hire where you live or remotely from your country and ranked against your profile, with the address each one publishes for applications. Dossier reads their sites politely and follows their robots.txt. Start an application to one with a click; you decide whom to write to.
- **Job agent (optional):** once a day it runs one search for you, skips what you've seen, scores the new postings against your profile and keeps the best on the Agent screen, with its reasons. It can prepare tailored drafts too, which wait for your review. It never sends or applies.
- **New application:** paste a posting; Dossier pulls out the details and requirements, matches them against your profile, and writes a tailored resume and cover letter in the tone you pick.
- **Never invents experience:** drafts only use facts from your profile. What the posting asks for and your profile doesn't have is shown as a gap, not made up.
- **Refine:** ask for changes in a chat, edit or regenerate any part (every part of the cover letter too: sender, date, recipient, greeting and sign-off, written in the letter's language), undo AI changes or go back to any earlier version, keep private notes.
- **Send:** an email to go with each application, to whoever the posting says to send it to, ready to copy or open in your mail app, with the resume and cover letter PDFs to attach. Edit, rewrite or refine it like the documents.
- **Claude connector (optional):** use Dossier from Claude, on claude.ai, in the Desktop and mobile apps or in Claude's command-line app, on your own Claude plan. Claude can search for jobs, score them against your profile, read your profile and applications, and save the resume and cover letter it writes as a Draft, checked like Dossier's own. It never sends or deletes anything. Without an AI model of Dossier's own, **Write it with Claude** hands a posting to a new Claude chat. Turn it on in Settings → Claude connector (see [Connecting Claude](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Claude)).
- **Gmail and Calendar (optional):** connect your Google account to send an application from your own address with its PDFs attached, see employers' replies next to each application, have the AI read what they ask and draft your answer from your profile, offer interview times you're free, and see your month and the week ahead on the dashboard, with interviews kept in step with Google Calendar both ways. Nothing is sent without your confirmation. Set it up by entering your Google OAuth client in Settings → Google, or with `DOSSIER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `DOSSIER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (see [Connecting Gmail and Calendar](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Gmail-and-Calendar)).
- **Track:** a board and a table of every application, and a dashboard with your funnel (last 30 days, 90 days or all time), a week-by-week chart, what's worth a look next, upcoming interviews included, and a calendar.
- **Your data:** export and import everything as one file, nightly backups, and Delete everything.

## Run it on your computer

All you need is [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on macOS or Windows, or Docker Engine with its Compose plugin on Linux, and about 2 GB of free memory. Run the commands in a terminal: macOS's Terminal, Linux, or WSL on Windows.

**1. Fetch the Compose file** into a folder of its own, and make the secrets Dossier needs:

```bash
mkdir ~/dossier && cd ~/dossier
curl -fsSL -o compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AienTech/dossier/main/compose.production.yml
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > .env
echo "DOSSIER_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
```

On an Apple Silicon Mac, also run `printf 'services:\n  app:\n    platform: linux/amd64\n' > compose.override.yml`: the image is built for Intel and AMD processors, and Docker Desktop runs it under emulation.

**2. Choose your password.** This asks for it twice and prints a hash of it, one line that starts with `argon2id:`:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/aientech/dossier hash-password
```

Add that line to `.env` as `DOSSIER_PASSWORD=argon2id:…`, with any text editor. Dossier only keeps the hash, never the password.

**3. Start it:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first start downloads the image (about 1.7 GB) and sets up the database. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign in with your password, and pick an AI model in **Settings → AI provider** (see [Choosing an AI provider](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-an-AI-provider)).

`docker compose stop` stops it and `docker compose start` starts it again, with your data kept. It's only reachable from your own computer. The [installation guide's Docker Compose page](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Run-locally-with-Docker-Compose) has more: another port, your time zone, upgrades and removing it.

## Build and run this fork

The steps above pull upstream's published image, without this fork's changes. To build this fork's own image instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulrathore95/dossier.git
cd dossier
docker build -t dossier-fork:latest .
```

This runs the same `Dockerfile` the published image is built from (the `production` stage, built by default), so the result is a drop-in replacement for `ghcr.io/aientech/dossier`. Then run it with [`compose.production.yml`](compose.production.yml), pointing `DOSSIER_IMAGE` at the image you just built instead of the published one:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dossier && cd ~/dossier
cp /path/to/this/repo/compose.production.yml compose.yml
echo "DOSSIER_IMAGE=dossier-fork:latest" > .env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" >> .env
echo "DOSSIER_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
docker run --rm -it dossier-fork:latest hash-password   # add the printed line to .env as DOSSIER_PASSWORD=…
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in. Rebuilding after a code change is the same `docker build` command, then `docker compose up -d` again to pick it up. [Choosing a job source](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-a-job-source) covers JSearch and Adzuna; for Firecrawl, get a key at [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys) and enter it in **Settings → Job search**, or set `DOSSIER_FIRECRAWL_KEY` the same way as the other sources' keys.

## Self-hosting

To put Dossier on a server, on your own domain with HTTPS, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki#self-host-on-a-server): a plain Ubuntu server with Docker Compose and Caddy (or Node.js, without Docker), CapRover, Coolify or Dokploy. Give the server at least 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of memory (see [Performance and sizing](#performance-and-sizing)).

## Documentation

The [wiki](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki) has what comes after installing:

- [Choosing an AI provider](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-an-AI-provider): a hosted model, or a local one with Ollama or LM Studio.
- [Choosing a job source](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Choosing-a-job-source): JSearch or Adzuna (and an unofficial one for Germany), and the job agent.
- [Connecting Gmail and Calendar](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Gmail-and-Calendar): your own Google OAuth client, step by step.
- [Connecting Claude](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Connecting-Claude): the Claude connector, in Claude's apps and on the command line.
- [Backups and restore](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Backups-and-restore): exports, nightly backups and database dumps.
- <a name="upgrading"></a>[Upgrading](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Upgrading) to a new version.
- [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Troubleshooting): what the common errors mean, and what to do about them.
- [Privacy](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Privacy): what stays on your server and what leaves it. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) has the details.
- [Environment variables](https://github.com/AienTech/dossier/wiki/Environment-variables): every setting the server reads.

## Known limitations

- **Desktop only:** made for a laptop or desktop browser, not for phones.
- **Single user:** one password and one profile; there are no accounts.
- **English interface:** the app itself is in English. Documents can be written in other languages; in the 21 built-in ones, their headings, dates and language levels are in that language too, and in one added with **Other language…** those stay in English.
- **One instance:** run a single copy of the app per database. The nightly backups, the AI job queue and the PDF browser live inside the app's process.

## Performance and sizing

Measured on 28 September 2026 with the production build in a container limited to 2 vCPUs and 1 GB:

- **PDFs:** the base resume renders in about 0.25 s, or 1 s when Chromium has to start first (it closes after five idle minutes). Two render at a time and the rest queue: six requested at once are done in 1.4 s. Dossier used at most about 520 MB, Chromium included, so give the container at least 768 MB.
- **Screens:** with ten times the demo data (90 applications), the dashboard and the applications list answer in 20–90 ms, and every query takes under a millisecond. With 900 applications they take up to about 0.2 s, mostly rendering; the tables are indexed for the queries they get.
- **Interactions** (changing a status, moving a card, switching tabs, opening an editor, typing, picking a theme) respond within 32 ms, and within about 100 ms on a CPU four times slower.
