- projects: every project from the profile, by id, with 1–3 bullets each, written like the roles' bullets: what was built and what it shows that this job cares about.
- skills: every one of the candidate's own skills, the ones this job asks for first. Copy their names exactly.
- education: every entry by id, with its notes shortened or left empty.
- The profile's publications go on the resume word for word, so don't answer with them; the summary may mention them.`;
